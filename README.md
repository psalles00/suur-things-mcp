# SUUR Things MCP

**Give any AI agent safe, structured access to your [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) tasks — plus a local, Things-faithful web dashboard with Kanban boards, an Eisenhower matrix, repo-linking, and a YouTube-thumbnail card view.**

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for **Things 3** (Cultured Code) on macOS. Let Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, or any MCP-capable agent read and manage your tasks, projects, and areas — and get a local dashboard that looks like Things but adds the views Things doesn't have.

**Install → connect your agent → ask "what should I work on?"**

```bash
# Connect it to Claude Code (Codex / Desktop below). uvx installs on first run.
claude mcp add suurthings -- uvx suur-things-mcp
```

Now ask your agent **"What should I work on today?"** — it reads your real Things lists and answers. Reads work immediately, no token. (Optional: `uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard` opens a local board at http://127.0.0.1:8765.) Add a token — see below — only when you want the agent to *modify* existing tasks.

---

## What it is (and the one design decision that matters)

Two data paths, deliberately split:

- **Reads** come straight from the local Things SQLite database — instant and complete: Today, Upcoming, Inbox, Anytime, Someday, Logbook, Trash, full-text search, projects, areas, tags, and full item detail.
- **Field writes** use the official [Things URL Scheme](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/). This local fork selects tasks with AppleScript and uses Things' native Move Up/Down keyboard shortcuts for exact ordering in Inbox and projects.

**Why this matters:** Cultured Code's [AI-integration guidance](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/5510170/) says direct database writes are unsafe. This fork never writes to SQLite. Ordering depends on macOS Accessibility access for the dedicated [SUUR Order helper](extras/suur-order/README.md) and Things' [Move Up/Down shortcuts](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/).

The dashboard accepts task reordering only within one heading, moves the selected task in Things, then reads the order back. If Things does not confirm the result, the dashboard reports an error. Dragging the Magic Plus creates a task through the URL Scheme before positioning it; if positioning fails, the task remains created and the dashboard says so. Install **SUUR Order** with `zsh extras/suur-order/install.sh`, then grant that helper access in macOS System Settings > Privacy & Security > Device Control and Data Access (Accessibility on older macOS versions) before using either drag operation.

> **Privacy:** an agent connected to this server can read your to-do and note content, which is then sent to whatever model you're using. Review your agent's privacy policy. Nothing here phones home; there's no telemetry and no bundled LLM.

### Why not direct DB writes?

Because Cultured Code says direct SQLite writes are unsafe. Reads use read-only connections; field changes use `things:///` URLs. The dashboard orders tasks through the SUUR Order helper, which selects a task with AppleScript and sends Things' native keyboard shortcuts.

## ✨ Beyond Things — what the dashboard adds

`uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard` runs a local board (`127.0.0.1:8765`) that *looks* like Things but adds the views and superpowers it doesn't have. Everything here is layered **on top** — your Things data stays untouched (boards, priorities, time-blocks, and repo links live in a local overlay, never written to Things).

**Plan & focus**
- 📆 **Five Days** — Choose 3–7 date columns in Preferences, starting with Today, above any number of chosen Things projects or Inbox. Hide scheduled tasks from the lower columns, move tasks between lists or dates, and collapse the sidebar for a wide planning view. All tasks stay visible as the page scrolls vertically; lists beyond the visible column count scroll horizontally. Task titles stay on one line; click for the full title. Exact placement between tasks is confirmed only when Things can order them within the same project, heading, or Inbox.
- 🟦 **Priority Matrix** — an Eisenhower matrix (Do First / Schedule / Delegate / Don't Do) as a one-click view on *any* list, project, or area. Drag tasks (and an area's projects) into quadrants.
- 🏷️ **Priority Levels** — a 2×2 grid (P1–P4) over Today *or any list/area/project*, ranked from your *existing* Things tags. Map a tag to each level (e.g. `🔴` → P1); drag a task between levels and the tag is rewritten in Things. Unlike the Matrix, the source of truth is your real tags — read-only without a token, otherwise fully bidirectional.
- 🗂️ **Area roll-up** — open an area and see the tasks inside its projects, grouped by project, not just the area's loose to-dos. A true overview of everything under the area.
- 📅 **Daily planning / time-blocking** — a day **Timeline** view: drag today's tasks onto a 6am–11pm grid in 15/30/60-min blocks to plan the day. (Times are a private dashboard overlay.)
- 🧘 **Calm Today** — one keystroke turns an overloaded Today into a single next action plus a short list and defers the rest. AI that *subtracts* noise instead of piling on features.
- 🎯 **Calm by design** — faithful Things look, light/dark, focus-friendly; completed tasks linger checked-off until they log, like the app.

**Build & ship (for devs)**
- 🔗 **Git repo links on projects** — connect a Things project/area to one or more local repos. Cards **and the project/area page** get one-click **Open in editor (⌨) / terminal (❯) / GitHub (↗)**, plus the git/GitHub pulse — even when the project isn't on a board.
- 📊 **Repo pulse** — board cards show recent commits + open-PR count for linked repos (via `git` + `gh`).
- 🧭 **Project boards** — saved portfolio Kanbans where each card is a whole project/area (progress ring + open count), dragged across your own stage columns.

**Capture, find & tidy**
- ⌘ **Command palette (⌘K)** — jump to any list/project/board, search tasks, create, switch view, and act on a task (complete / reschedule / move) — all keyboard-only.
- ➕ **Natural-language quick-add** — type `buy milk tomorrow #errand` and it's parsed into a real to-do.
- ↕ **Native task order (local fork)** — in a project or Inbox, drag a task beside another task in the same heading, or drag the top-right Plus onto a row to create there. The panel reads the order back from Things. Requires macOS Accessibility permission for SUUR Order.
- ◉ **Optional macOS menu bar utility** — shows whether the local dashboard is running and provides open/copy shortcuts. [Source and installation](extras/suur-menu/README.md).
- ◌ **Dedicated login app** — runs the dashboard under its own macOS app identity so its Things database access can be granted separately from Homebrew Python. [Setup and token instructions](extras/suur-dashboard/README.md).
- 🧹 **Agent triage** — *Triage Inbox* (propose a home + tags + date per item) and *Organize* (tidy titles/notes/tags). Your agent proposes; you review every change before anything is written.
- 🎬 **Cards view** — a project full of links becomes a wall of **YouTube thumbnails** (a perfect "watch later").
- 🏷 **Tag filter chips** + full-text **search** across everything; inline rename, column reorder, board-card progress rings.

All of it free, local, open source. No cloud, no account, no telemetry.

## Cool use cases — your agent + Things

These are the workflows this unlocks once an agent can see and shape your task system:

- **Plan → project, instantly.** Hand Claude an implementation plan and the `plan_to_project` prompt; it materializes a real Things project — a to-do per step with sub-tasks as checklist items — in one `batch` call. (Things' URL Scheme can't create headings, so phases get folded into titles/notes rather than faked.)
- **"What should I work on in this repo?"** Link a Things project to a local git repo. From inside that repo, the `work_on_repo` prompt resolves which project you're in (via `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` / cwd), pulls its open to-dos, and works the next one.
- **Sweep code TODOs into Things.** Point your agent at the codebase: it greps `TODO`/`FIXME`, and `batch`-creates to-dos with `file:line` references — no new tool needed, the agent already has Grep + this server.
- **Auto-organize a messy Inbox.** Hit the ✨ button on any folder (or use the `organize_folder` prompt). It spawns *your* agent **headlessly with zero tools and zero MCP**, so it can only *propose* cleaner titles/notes/tags — never write or be prompt-injected. You review every change before it's applied. (And yes, an agent can re-file Inbox items into the right projects — `update` supports moving via `list-id`.)
- **Natural-language capture, for free.** Things has no NLP input — and you don't need it: tell your agent *"add buy milk tomorrow 9am #errand"* and it parses and creates it. The dashboard's ＋ also takes light shorthand (`buy milk tomorrow #errand`). Your agent is the natural-language (and recurring) layer Things lacks.
- **AI that subtracts noise.** Most todo apps win by adding features; this one makes a calm app *smarter*, not busier. `calm_today` turns an overloaded Today into one next action plus a short list; triage files your Inbox. The intelligence is for *removing* work from your face, not piling it on.
- **One-call situational awareness.** `overview` returns a whole-system digest (counts, today, overdue, projects with no next action, recent completions) in a single call instead of ten.

(The dashboard's visual features — Matrix, Timeline, Cards, boards, repo links — are in [✨ Beyond Things](#-beyond-things--what-the-dashboard-adds) above.)

## Requirements

- macOS with [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) installed
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) — or any Python ≥ 3.10

## Install

`uvx` runs it with no manual install or virtualenv:

```bash
uvx suur-things-mcp            # run the MCP server over stdio
uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard  # run the dashboard instead
```

### Claude Code

```bash
# read-only (no token)
claude mcp add suurthings -- uvx suur-things-mcp

# read + write (modify existing items) — pass your token
claude mcp add suurthings --env THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here -- uvx suur-things-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop / Codex / other MCP clients

Add to your client's MCP config (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "suurthings": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["suur-things-mcp"],
      "env": { "THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
    }
  }
}
```

`THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` is **optional**. Without it you can read everything and *create* new to-dos/projects. It's only needed to **modify existing items**.

### Bleeding edge (straight from `main`, before a release lands on PyPI)

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/artyomsklyarov/suur-things-mcp suur-things-mcp
```

## Getting your Things auth token

1. **Things → Settings → General**
2. Enable **"Enable Things URLs"**
3. Click **Manage** and copy the token

Keep it secret — it grants write access via the URL Scheme. It's stored locally (see below), never in this repo.

## Updating

There's no custom "update" command — updates ride on whatever fetched the package. `uvx` caches, so:

```bash
uvx --refresh suur-things-mcp        # re-fetch the latest release, then restart your MCP client
```

If you installed it as a persistent tool:

```bash
uv tool install suur-things-mcp      # one-time
uv tool upgrade suur-things-mcp      # update later
```

Nuclear option (clear the cache): `uv cache clean suur-things-mcp`. From `main`, add `--refresh` to the git command above.

## Tools (31)

### Read — no token required

| Tool | Returns |
|------|---------|
| `overview` | One-call system digest: counts, today, overdue, projects with no next action, recent completions |
| `get_today` | Today (incl. overdue + this evening) |
| `get_inbox` | Inbox |
| `get_upcoming` | Scheduled, future-dated to-dos |
| `get_anytime` / `get_someday` | Anytime / Someday lists |
| `get_logbook` | Recently completed/canceled (`limit`) |
| `get_deadlines` | To-dos with deadlines |
| `get_trash` | Trash |
| `search_todos` | Full-text search over titles + notes |
| `list_todos` | Filter by project / area / tag / status / bucket |
| `get_projects` / `get_areas` / `get_tags` | Structure (`include_items` for contents) |
| `get_item` | Full detail for any UUID |
| `current_link` / `list_links` | Repo-link lookups (see below) |

### Write — via the URL Scheme

| Tool | Token? |
|------|:------:|
| `add_todo`, `add_project` | no |
| `show` (navigate Things to a list/item) | no |
| `open_dashboard` (open the local board) | no |
| `link_repo`, `unlink_repo` | no (config only) |
| `attach_image` (attach an image to an item) | no to store; **yes** to also add a notes reference |
| `batch` (bulk create/update via the `json` command) | only if it contains updates |
| `update_todo`, `update_project` | **yes** |
| `complete_todo`, `cancel_todo`, `schedule_todo` | **yes** |
| `add_checklist_items` | **yes** |

> The URL Scheme doesn't return a new item's UUID on create. After `add_todo`/`add_project`, use `search_todos` if you need the ID.

## Prompts

Packaged MCP **prompts** — workflows your client surfaces as slash commands. In Claude Code they appear as **`/mcp__suurthings__<prompt>`** (type `/` to see them, e.g. `/mcp__suurthings__weekly_review`). The `mcp__<server>__` prefix is Claude Code's convention; `suurthings` is the name you register the server under:

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `plan_to_project` | Turn an implementation plan into a Things project — a to-do per step, sub-tasks as checklist items — via `batch` (no headings; URL-Scheme limit) |
| `work_on_repo` | From inside a linked repo, resolve its Things project, pull open to-dos, work the next one |
| `organize_folder` | Propose clearer titles/notes/tags for a folder (reusing existing tags), review in chat, apply on approval |
| `weekly_review` | GTD weekly review — flag stalled projects, rotting Someday items, overdue deadlines; propose fixes |
| `triage_inbox` | Propose a project/area + tags + `when` per Inbox item; file on approval |
| `whats_next` | Rank Today/Anytime by deadline, age, and your tags; recommend the single next task |
| `standup` | Yesterday's logbook + today + blocked, formatted to paste into Slack or a PR |
| `capture_todos` | Sweep code `TODO`/`FIXME` into Things to-dos with `file:line` references |
| `close_from_commit` | Complete the Things to-dos a git commit resolved |
| `repo_to_issue` | Promote a Things to-do to a GitHub issue (via `gh`) and link them |
| `issues_to_todos` | Mirror a repo's open GitHub issues into Things to-dos under its linked project |

The GTD and code/GitHub prompts use only the existing tools (plus the agent's own Grep/Bash/`gh`) — the server stays dumb. A few more polish ideas live on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Dashboard

A local web UI that mirrors the Things look (real glyphs, typography, edit card) and adds the views Things lacks. Binds `127.0.0.1` only, reads the DB read-only, and **always runs on port 8765** (it reuses a live instance instead of spawning duplicates).

```bash
uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard        # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765 in your browser
uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard --app  # opens it in a frameless app window (no tabs/toolbar)
uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard --install-service   # always-on: launchd KeepAlive service at login
uvx suur-things-mcp dashboard --uninstall-service # remove the service again
```

`--app` launches a Chromium browser (Chrome / Brave / Edge / Chromium / Vivaldi / Arc) in app mode — a standalone window with its own Dock icon, no address bar — and falls back to a normal tab if none are installed. Or have the agent open it with the `open_dashboard` tool (pass `app=true` for the same window).

**Sidebar** — Things' built-in lists (with their real colored icons), a **Priority Matrix** and **Priority Levels** entry, your saved **project boards**, and areas with nested projects + progress rings. Opening an **area** shows its loose to-dos *plus* the tasks inside its projects, grouped by project (project cards stay on top for quick nav). A **"Project tasks"** pill in the header (beside the view switcher) turns that roll-up off, per area. Tag **filter chips** sit under any list's title. A **search box** runs `things.search` over your whole database.

**Three views, toggled per list (List / Matrix / Cards):**

- **List** — the faithful Things grouped list (by project/heading), with the Things-style inline edit card (checkbox + title, Notes, When/deadline/tag pills, footer toolbar). Edits **save on close, only if you changed something.**
- **Matrix** — an Eisenhower matrix over *that* list's tasks. Drag into **Do First / Schedule / Delegate / Don't Do**. On an area, its **projects** are draggable too. Priority is **global per task** (set it anywhere, see it everywhere). The sidebar **Priority Matrix** entry is the matrix over Today.

The sidebar **Priority Levels** entry is a different ranking: four bands (P1–P4) filled from your **existing Things tags** via a tag→level map (⚙ to edit). A task sits at the first level whose tags it carries; drag it to another band and the mapped tag is rewritten in Things (old level tag replaced). Read-only without `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- **Cards** — task cards; anything with a **YouTube link renders as a thumbnail** (other links get a 🔗 tile). Great for a "watch later" project.

**Project boards** — saved portfolio Kanbans. Each **card is a project or whole area** (progress ring + open count), dragged between **stage columns** (Backlog / In Progress / On Hold / Done). Add multiple named boards with the ＋ on the Boards group; configure name / columns / included areas+projects in the ⚙ panel (auto-saves).

**Repo links** — link a Things project/area to one or more local git repos (an app + its website, say). GitHub is **auto-detected** from the repo's `origin` remote. Board cards get **Open in editor (⌨) / terminal (❯) / GitHub (↗)** buttons; set your editor command + terminal app in **⚙ Preferences** (or `SUUR_THINGS_EDITOR` / `SUUR_THINGS_TERMINAL`).

Stage placement and priority quadrants are **browser-side overlays** — Things has no such concept — so dragging needs **no token**. Editing a task's fields *does* write to Things (URL Scheme) and needs `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN`; without it the edit card is read-only.

**Live & low-friction:** the board **auto-refreshes** (~25 s poll; it pauses while you're editing, dragging, filtering, searching, or in a background tab, and keeps your scroll position). **Drag a task onto Today / Anytime / Someday** in the sidebar to reschedule it (`when=`). Your current view + theme survive a refresh (state is in the URL hash).

---

## Where your data lives

Three tiers — important if you switch machines:

1. **Real task data → Things' own database.** Anything you change that's a Things field (title, notes, when, deadline, tags, complete/cancel, move) is written via the URL Scheme into Things, and syncs across your devices through Things Cloud like normal. This server never stores your tasks.
2. **Dashboard config → one local JSON file.**
   - `~/.config/suur-things-mcp/board.json` — your boards, Priority-Matrix assignments, the Priority-Levels tag map, per-area roll-up prefs, repo links, prefs, and image-attachment metadata (keyed by stable Things UUIDs).
   - `~/.config/suur-things-mcp/attachments/` — image files you attach to tasks (Things can't store images; the dashboard shows them and writes a `file://` reference into the task's notes).
   - `~/.config/suur-things-mcp/token` — your Things auth token (chmod 600).

   Not in the browser, not in Things. (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is honored if set.)
3. **Browser localStorage** — only cosmetic state (light/dark, which areas are collapsed). Nothing you'd miss.

**Backup / move machines:** copy or symlink `~/.config/suur-things-mcp/` (e.g. into Dropbox). Caveats: the **token is a secret** (fine in personal storage, never in a public repo); **repo links store absolute paths** that are machine-specific — the UUID-keyed boards/priorities port cleanly, the paths may need repointing; and **attached images are not in Things Cloud** — they only appear where this folder syncs (not on your iPhone's Things), though the `file://` note reference travels with the task.

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Required to modify existing items (tools) and to edit/move in the dashboard |
| `THINGS_DB` | Override the SQLite path (e.g. point at a backup for testing) |
| `SUUR_THINGS_CONFIG` | Override the `board.json` path |
| `SUUR_THINGS_EDITOR` / `SUUR_THINGS_TERMINAL` | Default editor command / terminal app for repo-launch buttons |
| `SUUR_THINGS_AGENT` | Which CLI the ✨ organize button spawns (`claude` / `codex`) |

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐   read  (SQLite, read-only)    ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  MCP client  │ ─────────────────────────────▶ │  things.py → main.sqlite  │
│ (Claude/etc) │                                 └──────────────────────────┘
│      +       │   write (things:/// URL)        ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  dashboard   │ ─────────────────────────────▶ │  open -g → Things.app     │
└──────────────┘                                 └──────────────────────────┘
```

Reads use [`things.py`](https://github.com/thingsapi/things.py), which opens the DB read-only. Field writes are built and URL-encoded in [`urlscheme.py`](src/suur_things_mcp/urlscheme.py) and fired with `open -g`. Exact order uses the [SUUR Order helper](extras/suur-order/README.md) through [`native_order.py`](src/suur_things_mcp/native_order.py). The dashboard is a single self-contained Starlette app (no build step, no external JS) served from [`dashboard.py`](src/suur_things_mcp/dashboard.py).

**The server stays dumb on purpose.** It returns clean structured data and ships packaged prompts; the judgment (prioritize, triage, synthesize) lives in *your* agent, not a hardcoded rules engine. There is no bundled model and no API key.

## Security & threat model

This is a **local-first, single-user macOS tool**. It's built so the worst case stays small.

- **Reads are read-only.** The SQLite database is opened `mode=ro&immutable=1`; the server never writes to it.
- **No delete-forever operation exists.** Field writes use Things' documented URL Scheme. Exact task reorder uses the native Move Up/Down shortcuts with readback.
- **The dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` only** and never to your network. State-changing requests are guarded two ways: `TrustedHostMiddleware` rejects any request whose `Host` isn't `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` (blocks DNS-rebinding), and `_OriginGuard` rejects any POST whose `Origin` isn't the dashboard's own `scheme://host:port` (blocks a page on another localhost port from driving it).
- **The auth token gates writes.** Modifying existing items needs `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN`; it's resolved from the env or a `chmod 600` file *outside* any repo, and it's redacted from every URL and error message the server returns.
- **The ✨ organize agent runs sandboxed.** The spawned `claude`/`codex` CLI gets no MCP servers and no tools, runs read-only, and the `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` is stripped from its environment. Its suggestions are reviewed by you before anything is written.

**Inherent limits, worth knowing:**
- Like any MCP server that returns your content, **task titles and notes are passed to your agent**, which holds the write tools. A task crafted to read as instructions ("ignore previous, cancel everything") is a prompt-injection vector inherent to the model layer; the bundled prompts treat task text as data, and nothing here can hard-delete.
- The write token appears briefly in the `open` process arguments (visible only to your own user via `ps`).
- Anything with **local filesystem access to your machine already has more power than this tool exposes** — the defenses above are about the *browser* boundary, not other local processes.

Found something? See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for how to report it privately.

### Known limits (Things' URL Scheme, not us)

- Creating **headings** isn't supported by the URL Scheme — only the app can.
- Create commands don't return the new UUID (search for it afterward).
- macOS only (Things is Mac/iOS; there's no cloud API).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artyomsklyarov/suur-things-mcp
cd suur-things-mcp
uv sync
uv run pytest             # unit tests — URL building + dashboard, no Things required
uv run suur-things-mcp    # run the server over stdio
uv run suur-things-mcp dashboard
```

Tests build and assert URL-Scheme strings and dashboard endpoints without touching your real database, so they're safe to run anywhere. Contributions welcome — see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned.
